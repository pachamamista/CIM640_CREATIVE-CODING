## MIDTERM Notes 10/14/2018

### KITTY PARADISE

#### Explanation:
#### Why are you making this project? What is your motivation?
This project is to learn how to make little fun illustrations and interactions.
My motivation behind it was to try to make a cute illustration and have it
move and be able to have some trigger buttons and make it interactive.

#### What are your inputs?
Inputs are the drop down menu, mouse pressed and key pressed.

#### What are your outputs?
Outputs are the result of pressing down certain buttons.
There are a couple of items that will appear and disappear and other surprises.

#### Who is the target audience for your project?
The target audience for this particular project are little kids

#### Where will your project be displayed?
This project would be displayed in areas where kids would be waiting around
so they don't get bored.

#### In your sketch, include a title and instruction (3 Points) and a background image (2 Points)
#### A display font was also used for the instructions.
I have included the name of the sketch, the title and simple instructions for the user.
A background image is used for the living room. 


#### 5 points of Interaction (15 Points - 3 Points each)
#### buttons
I have 3 buttons, a mousePress and a mouseDragged
One will make the cat's paw move (array), another will trigger the yarn to move,
the other button will trigger the cat to swat and for a mouse to appear and move.

#### selection.value
Created a drop down menu with options

#### mouseX mouseY
For this, I also used mousePressed option where hearts drop down. Anywhere the user
clicks, hearts will drop down.

#### mousePressed
Another mouse pressed option I have is to make it rain cats. This is fun :)

#### mouseDragged
There is one hit zone that you drag your mouse over and an image appears below.
