## FINAL IDEAS 11/6/2018

### FEATHERS ARE FALLING - MAKE A WISH

#### Document 3 potential ideas for your final.
#### IDEA 1
My first idea is to make a game:
• The user clicks on a button to start game.
• On the screen you see there are 3 birds on the side and instructions would
say to catch feathers.
• Feathers start falling from the sky and as the user catches feathers,
the birds start taking flight and once each bird has all his feathers, it flies away. 
• Once all 3 birds get their feathers and fly away, user wins.

#### IDEA 2
Inputs are the drop down menu, mouse pressed and key pressed.

#### Find and Link 3 examples of similar projects or projects that influence your project.
