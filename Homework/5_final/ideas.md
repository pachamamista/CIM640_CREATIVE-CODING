## FINAL IDEAS 11/6/2018

### FEATHERS ARE FALLING - MAKE A WISH

#### Document 3 potential ideas for your final.
#### IDEA 1
My first idea is to make a game:
The user clicks on a button to start game.
On the screen you see there are 3 birds on the side and instructions would
say to catch feathers.
Feathers start falling from the sky and as the user catches feathers,
the birds start taking flight and once each bird has all his feathers, it flies away.
Once all 3 birds get their feathers and fly away, user wins.

#### IDEA 2
My second idea is to make an installation:
With video capture, the user would step on a specified space and a kaleidoscope
will show up and follow the user and move around according to their movements.
