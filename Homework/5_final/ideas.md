# CIM640 - Fall 2018

## FINAL IDEAS 11/6/2018

### FEATHERS ARE FALLING - MAKE A WISH

#### Document 3 potential ideas for your final.
#### IDEA 1
My first idea is to make a game:
The user clicks on a button to start game.
On the screen you see there are 3 birds on the side and instructions would
say to catch feathers.
Feathers start falling from the sky and as the user catches feathers,
the birds start taking flight and once each bird has all his feathers, it flies away.
Once all 3 birds get their feathers and fly away, user wins.

#### IDEA 2
My second idea is to make an installation:
With video capture, the user would step on a specified space and a kaleidoscope
will show up and follow the user and move around according to their movements.

#### IDEA 3
My third idea is to make an installation:
I am not sure how I would create this, the brainstorm we did last class was mostly about
feathers and I got an idea from my class partner. I wanted to have feathers free-falling
in an enclosed space which would be aligned with fans blowing air. Feathers would change colors based on light projection and then also they would stay up in the air by the
air flow from the fans.
